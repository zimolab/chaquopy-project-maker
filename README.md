# Chaquopy Project Maker

This is a tool to help you create a new Chaquopy-based Android Studio project quickly.

---
> Chaquopy provides everything you need to include Python components in an Android app, including:
> - Full integration with Android Studioâ€™s standard Gradle build system.
> - Simple APIs for calling Python code from Java/Kotlin, and vice versa.
> - A wide range of third-party Python packages, including SciPy, OpenCV, TensorFlow and many more.

The project configuration process is a little bit complicated and tedious, so I make this tool to make it easier.

This tool uses cookiecutter to do the project generation, and the default cookiecutter template is distributed as a git 
submodule which can be found [here](https://github.com/zimolab/HelloChaquopy).

This tool is a GUI program, and it uses [PyGUIAdapter](https://github.com/zimolab/PyGUIAdapter) to make the GUI.

You can also make your own cookiecutter template from the default one. Just don't forget to including the following 
configs in your own template's `cookiecutter.json`. 

```json
{
  "project_name": "Hello Chaquopy",
  "project_slug": "{{ cookiecutter.project_name.title().replace(' ', '') }}",

## How to use

A pre-built executable (Using pyinstaller) for Windows is provided currently, you can download it from the release page.

The GUI is pretty simple and straightforward.

For other platforms, you can clone the repository and run it from the command line:

```commandline
$ git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/zimolab/chaquopy-project-maker.git
```

install the dependencies:
```commandline
$ cd chaquopy-project-maker
$ poetry install
```

(activate the virtual environment and) run the `main.py` file:
```commandline
$ python chaquopy_project_maker/main.py
```

Or you can use pyinstaller to make your own executable. Check the [ChaquopyProjectMaker.spec](ChaquopyProjectMaker.spec)
for reference.
